# Computer_Vision-Rock_Paper_Scissors
Computer vision project using the rock paper scissors games with the web camera

Milestone One
Using the teachable machine tool, I have trained a model using hundreds on 
images of a rock, paper and scissors, using hand gestures. The code from 
the model has then been exported and will be used in other milestones
