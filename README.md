# Computer_Vision-Rock_Paper_Scissors
Computer vision project using the rock paper scissors games with the web camera

Milestone One
Using the teachable machine tool, I have trained a model using hundreds on 
images of a rock, paper and scissors, using hand gestures. The code from 
the model has then been exported and will be used in other milestones

Milestone Two
Using the conda tool in terminal, I created a virtual environment within which I 
could install the necessary required modules without affecting the main installation.

Milestone Three
Using functions and if conditions, I created various scenarios for the game choice
pairing, then used a function to call all other functions. This function will be the
main function to play the game, thus its name "play".
